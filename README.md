###What it this?
This is my personal website. Here you'll find some of the project that I think are worth sharing. If you like what you see, reach out to me at [me@leogenerali.com](me@leogenerali.com) or on twitter [https://twitter.com/itsLeeOhGee](here).

You can check out the website proper at [http://www.leogenerali.com/](leogenerali.com).

###Created With:
* HTML
* CSS Framework: Skeleton
* Javascript

###Things I Want to Update in the Future:
* The game code could be a lot more efficient. Some of the functions break the cardinal **DRY** rule.
* I want to restyle the page with SASS for practice.
